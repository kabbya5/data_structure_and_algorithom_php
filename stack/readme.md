In PHP, a stack and queue are data structures that store and manage collections of items.
They are fundamental concepts in computer science used for managing data in a particular order.
Below is an overview of both:

Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
A stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Operations on Stack:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
Peek (Top): Views the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

Time Complexity of Stack Operations:
Push Operation (push($val)):

Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: In a stack implemented using a linked list, when you push an element,
you simply create a new node and link it to the current top (or first) node. 
No iteration or traversal of the list is required, so this operation is done in constant time.
Pop Operation (pop()):

Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: In a stack, popping removes the top node. You update the first pointer to point to the next node, and the old node is discarded. Again, this operation does not require any iteration, so it runs in constant time.
Peek Operation (peek()):

Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: The peek operation simply returns the value of the top node without removing it. This can be done in constant time by directly accessing the first node.
Is Empty Operation (isEmpty()):

Time Complexity: O(1)
Explanation: Checking whether the stack is empty only requires checking if the first pointer is null. This is a constant-time operation.

Summary:
Push: O(1)
Pop: O(1)
Peek: O(1)
Is Empty: O(1)
Space: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack.

These time complexities make stacks very efficient for handling data in a LIFO (Last In, First Out) manner.
