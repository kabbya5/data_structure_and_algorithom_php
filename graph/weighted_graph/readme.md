A weighted graph is a type of graph in data structures where each edge has an associated weight or cost. These weights often represent distances, costs, or other quantitative attributes between nodes.
### Applications of Weighted Graphs
### 1 Shortest Path Algorithms
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
### 2 Minimum Spanning Tree
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
### 3 Network Flow Analysis
 - Maximum Flow Problem
### 4 Routing and Navigation
 - Used in GPS and mapping systems.
### 5 Search Algorithms
 - Depth-First Search (DFS)
 - Breadth-First Search (BFS
