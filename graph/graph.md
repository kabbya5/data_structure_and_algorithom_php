### Example

### Vertices (Nodes):

### Labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and F 
These represent points in the graph.
Edges (Arrows):

Directed edges (arrows) point from one node to another.
The direction of the arrow indicates the flow or relationship from the start node to the end node.
Directed Relationships:

There is an arrow from A to B, meaning a direct path from node A to node B.
Similarly, arrows are from B to c, C to E, etc.
